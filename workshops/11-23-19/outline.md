# Julia-Users-Group Fall Workshop

## Date and Place
November 23rd, 2019

10 am - 4 pm Co-Up, 3rd floor, Adalbertstr. 7-8, 810999 Berlin-Kreuzberg

## About
This workshop is for everybody who is interested in learning Julia all levels welcome.
Pre-requirements: You read our Code of Conduct (http://www.opentechschool.org/code-of-conduct/) and appreciate the content.

10 am: We will give a quick introduction to the language
1) Key features of the language and differences to other languages
2) Which applications are particularly promising
3) How to get started programming in Julia

10.45 am: We split into balanced groups, depending on your previous experience (with similar languages)
and your interests and we will offer a wide range of learning material.
More experienced Julia users will help you whenever you get stuck.

2 pm: We will be a bit more creative and work on several projects, e.g.
- writing our own opentechschool tutorial(s)
- implementing your current project into Julia
- working on more advanced stuff, e.g. https://github.com/julia-users-berlin/julia-users-workshop/blob/master/list_of_resources.md

Why Julia? -- Julia is Open Source. Julia is integrative: beginners can use it, but also experts often prefer it over C or Fortran.
It is nearly as fast as C, but as easy to program as Python. In recent years, many computer and data scientists have switched to Julia 
as it seems to be the most future-proof language for large numerical operations.
Today, Julia nicely complements Python and R when not only the comfort of an open source language that is easy to read and write
but also speed is required.

What is Julia made for? -- Julia is a general purpose language like Python, but it shines particularly when heavy computation is necessary
and the alternatives are either to slow or require a lot of time to be implemented, e.g. data science, engineering, differential equations. Moreover, package development for Julia is rather convenient so that many scientists have switched to implement their packages in Julia.

Will Julia be the future? -- According to the [Julia developer survey](https://julialang.org/images/2019-julia-user-developer-survey.pdf) Julia users are convinced it is, come and find out why.
Julia reached version 1.0 in summer 2018 which indicates a stable programming experience and it is rapidly improving.
